### Hallucination Detection

**Binary Classification:**
- **True (Hallucination Detected):** Response contains non-existent files, commands, or features
- **False (No Hallucination):** Response is factually accurate

**Common Hallucination Patterns:**
- Non-existent file paths
- Invalid npm commands
- Fictional API endpoints
- Made-up configuration files
- Incorrect technical specifications

## Implementation

### Node.js Integration

The evaluation framework integrates with your existing Node.js backend:

```javascript
// Example usage in your Listify Agent
import { evaluateResponse } from './evaluations/arizeEvaluators.js';

const evaluation = await evaluateResponse({
  userQuery: "How do I add a new category?",
  agentResponse: "Edit backend/src/services/imageAnalysisService.js...",
  context: { availableFiles: actualFiles }
});

// Log to Arize
await logEvaluationToArize(evaluation);
```

### Python Evaluation Functions

For complex LLM-as-judge evaluations:

```python
from arize_evaluators import evaluate_tone, detect_hallucinations

# Tone evaluation using LLM-as-judge
tone_score = evaluate_tone(
    user_query="Help me fix this error",
    agent_response="I'll help you troubleshoot this issue..."
)

# Hallucination detection
hallucination_result = detect_hallucinations(
    response="Edit categories.config.js",
    codebase_files=actual_files
)
```

## Dashboard Configuration

### Arize Dashboard Setup

1. **Navigate to your Arize project:** `listify-agent`
2. **Create custom metrics** for each evaluation score
3. **Set up alerts** for quality thresholds
4. **Configure dashboards** for monitoring

### Key Dashboards

#### Quality Metrics Dashboard
- Average tone score (target: > 4.0)
- Average correctness score (target: > 4.0)
- Hallucination rate (target: < 5%)
- Tool accuracy score (target: > 4.0)

#### Performance Dashboard
- P95 latency (target: < 7s)
- Tokens per second
- Error rate
- Response time distribution

#### Cost Dashboard
- Cost per request type
- Daily/monthly spend
- Cost by feature
- Token usage trends

## Alert Configuration

### Quality Alerts

```yaml
high_hallucination_rate:
  condition: "hallucination_rate > 5%"
  window: "1 hour"
  action: "slack_notification"

poor_quality:
  condition: "avg_correctness < 3.5"
  window: "1 hour"
  action: "email_alert"

tone_degradation:
  condition: "avg_tone_score < 3.0"
  window: "30 minutes"
  action: "immediate_alert"
```

### Performance Alerts

```yaml
high_latency:
  condition: "p95_latency > 10s"
  window: "5 minutes"
  action: "slack_notification"

cost_spike:
  condition: "hourly_cost > $5"
  window: "1 hour"
  action: "email_alert"
```
