# 🔧 **CRITICAL FIX: Arize Endpoint Configuration**

## **🚨 ISSUE FOUND:**

Your Arize configuration has a **critical mismatch**:

- **Code:** Uses GRPC exporter (`@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-grpc`)
- **Your Endpoint:** `https://otlp.arize.com/v1/traces` (HTTP endpoint)
- **Should Be:** `https://otlp.arize.com/v1` (GRPC endpoint)

## **✅ QUICK FIX:**

### **Step 1: Update Render Environment Variable**
In your Render dashboard, change:
```
ARIZE_ENDPOINT = https://otlp.arize.com/v1/traces
```
To:
```
ARIZE_ENDPOINT = https://otlp.arize.com/v1
```

### **Step 2: Save and Wait**
1. Click **"Save Changes"** in Render
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for redeployment
3. Check logs for: `✅ Arize tracing initialized successfully`

## **🔍 WHY THIS FIXES IT:**

**Before (Wrong):**
- GRPC exporter trying to connect to HTTP endpoint
- Traces fail to send (silent failure)
- No traces appear in dashboard

**After (Correct):**
- GRPC exporter connects to GRPC endpoint
- Traces send successfully
- Traces appear in Arize dashboard

## **📊 EXPECTED RESULTS:**

After the fix, you should see:
```
🔧 Initializing Arize tracing with MCP best practices...
📡 Endpoint: https://otlp.arize.com/v1
✅ Arize tracing initialized successfully
```

And traces will appear in your Arize dashboard!

## **🎯 ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:**

If you prefer to use HTTP instead of GRPC, I can update the code to use the HTTP exporter. But the GRPC endpoint fix above is the quickest solution.

**This endpoint mismatch is why you're not seeing traces after 17:13!** 🎯
